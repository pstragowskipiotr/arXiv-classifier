We study the variation of Riemannian metrics for the zeta function and functional determinant of D^2, and prove finiteness of the Morse index at stationary metrics, and local extremality at such metrics under general, i.e. not only conformal, change of metrics.  In even dimensions, which is also a new case for the conformal Laplacian, the relevant stability operator is of log-polyhomogeneous pseudodifferential type, and we prove new results of independent interest, on the spectrum for such operators. We use this to prove local extremality under variation of the Riemannian metric, which in the important example when (M^n, g) is the round n-sphere, gives a partial verification of Branson's conjecture on the pattern of extremals. Thus det(D^2) has a local (max, max, min, min) when the dimension is (4k, 4k + 1, 4k + 2, 4k + 3), respectively.\"},\n",

This is what we prove in this paper. This construction gives the first example towards a more systematic study of Kolyvagin system theory over an Iwasawa algebra when the core Selmer rank is greater than one. As a result of this construction, we reduce the main conjectures of Iwasawa theory for totally real fields to a statement of local Iwasawa theory. This statement, however, turns out to be interesting in its own right as it suggests a relation between solutions to $p$-adic and complex Stark conjectures.'}]"
